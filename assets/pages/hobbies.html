    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Web Development</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>My recruitment experience was based in the tech industry; this is where I gained exposure to various elements of computer science, eventually discovering a passion for Web Development!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Video Games</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I love playing video games to relax in my spare time. I prefer competitive games, such as Valorant, where you are competing against other players.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Streaming</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I routinely stream my games on Twitch as a hobby of mine as I enjoy gaming experiences best when they are with other people.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reading</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading is another activity I do to relax, usually before bed. I mostly read fiction, educational, and philosophical content. Currently I am Reading <em>Crooked Kingdom</em> by <em>Leigh Bardugo</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Video Editing</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a newer hobbie of mine that works in combination with streaming, where I take the video from my streaming and would edit them down into more consumable content for other content sites such as Youtube or TikTok. To that end I am currently learning how Dvinci Resolve works as my chosen editing software.</li>
            </ul>
